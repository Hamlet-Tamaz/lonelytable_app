# lonelytable

Lonely Table is a concept application for booking tables at various venues. There is a twist to this booking procedure; however, because this project is currently in development, I will not discuss the details. 

The project's purpose was to create a platform with which to be able to easily search for available tables at nightlife venues using a variety of filters that one may not easily find through more traditional searches. This is only the first model for this concept, and all sections of the application would contain more detailed information and richer content. 

The easy aspect refers to not only simplicity of use, but also quickness of completion of the reservations. I wanted to minimize the number of steps it takes to pick a table, reserve it, and enjoy the benefits. For this reason, there are two main, functional pages: one where you pick the club, the other where you pick the table. In further development of the application, there will be more pages in the path to confirm details of the reservation, and there will also be more details provided about the clubs. This information is contingent upon the clubs themselves, and what information they will want to share. 

The landing page provides all you need to familiarize yourself with us and the application itself linking you to the "About Us" page, as well as a "Getting Started" page which will explain the unique experience LonelyTable will provide. As with every innovation, there is a slight learning curve. Additionally, there will be areas for featured content, news, etc. The next step in the application takes you the "Venues" page, where the core of the application takes place.

Currently, the information in the website is seeded, but in a production version, the app would have a CRUD interface for venues for them to create and update their available tables on their own, and manage how they interact with their guests. After selecting your venue, you can see all the tables that they have, with more details both about the venue and the table itself.

At its most basic form, the website was to provide basic information about the venues including the tables that are available, what the location of that table is inside the club, a look inside a club if available, the prices, musical genres, atmosphere, and Yelp rating.

After you reserve the table, you receive a confirmation with which you can prove at the venue that you ordered that table.
